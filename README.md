**1. Adding Well Tests to Prosper Models**

The user only needs to input the main field's well test data file path into the "Main code" section.
Additional information about this script can be found in the thesis.

**2. VLP Assessment**

The user should input the file path where the specific field's Prosper models are located on their computer into the "Main code" section and change the well tests being investigated.
Additional information about this script can be found in the thesis.

**3. Results Analysis and 4. Results Analysis - Pressure Loss Approach - Overall Performance**

The user should input the file paths of all the fields included in this study, as shown in the "Data entry and processing" section.
Additional information about these scripts can be found in the thesis.


**5. Correlation Strategy**

The user should input the file paths of all the fields included in this study, as indicated in the "Data entry and processing" section.
After running the script, the parameters under investigation will be displayed on the "Correlation Strategy" terminal. 
There, the user is required to input the conditions at hand. 
Additional information about these scripts can be found in the thesis.

**6. Machine Learning Model**

The user should input the file paths of all the fields included in this study, as outlined in the "Array and Correlations" section.
The user then enters the Gauge depth, tubing head pressure, water cut, GOR, and liquid rate in the "new_data" array, and the model will automatically generate the downhole pressure prediction. 
Additional information about these scripts can be found in the thesis.
